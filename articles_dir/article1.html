           <p class="article_text">The $1,000 phone may not be as shocking this year
                as it was when Apple first broke the barrier with
                 2017's iPhone X, but the amount you're asked to 
                 cough up for a premium handset is hardly chump 
                 change. The newly announced iPhone XS and August's
                  Galaxy Note 9 both start at a grand, and the
                   higher-storage models go up from there.
                    (See the charts below for international pricing.)
               
               So what do these phones have to justify the
                $1,000 price tag? And which one is the better
                 buy? While we can't say for certain until
                  we've tested the iPhone XS' new features side by
                   side with the Galaxy Note 9, we have a pretty good 
                   idea now of what they offer, and how they compete for your affection -- and your cash.
               
               And remember too, both these phones have smaller,
                cheaper counterparts. The iPhone XR is a slightly stripped-down 
                version of the iPhone XS and starts at $750. Samsung's Galaxy
                 S9 and S9 Plus are essentially Note 9s minus the S Pen, some of 
                 the camera features and the massive storage space and battery.
                  The Galaxy S9 starts at $720 (varies by carrier).</p>
