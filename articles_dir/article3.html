         <p class="article_text">New Delhi: As the festive season inches closer in India, Vivo is focused on building brand loyalty
                and offering consumers innovative new 
                "made in India" products across all price segments,
                 a top company official said here on Tuesday.
               
               The Chinese smartphone maker is set to launch
                another flagship smartphone Vivo V11 Pro on September 6.
               
               "When it comes to the V series, Vivo has done very well.
                And with V11 Pro, we will take innovation to the next 
                level in Rs 20,000-Rs 30,000 segment," Nipun Marya, 
                Director, Brand Strategy, Vivo India, told IANS.
               
               "To be successful in the long term, we must have great products. 
               That is the reason why you see so many innovations from Vivo,
                whether it is the elevating camera in Vivo Nex or the in-display 
                fingerprint scanner in X21," he added.</p>
