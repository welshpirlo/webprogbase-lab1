        <p class="article_text">Rarely do smartphone reviews require much context
                ahead of talking about the device, but the Pocophone
                 F1 is a phone that warrants a proper introduction.
                  The name itself should be a giveaway as to why,
                   because unless you’re plugged into the international
                    smartphone world, this new brand may not sound familiar.
               
               Pocophone’s partner in all this is Xiaomi, a name more
                will know. Xiaomi provides its manufacturing and software expertise,
                 the benefits of scale — which includes buying power and industry 
                 connections — and years of experience. Pocophone isn’t Honor 
                 to Xiaomi’s Huawei, as it follows completely its own design
                  and promotional path; but the F1 and presumably future Pocophone
                   devices will be available almost everywhere Xiaomi phones are. 
                   That includes parts of Europe, and potentially, the U.K. and 
                   the U.S. in the future.
               
               You’ll want the Pocophone to go on sale near you: 
               It’s shockingly good, and all for an almost unbelievably low price.
                There are several companies out there that should be looking nervously 
                back at Pocophone, and here’s why.</p>
